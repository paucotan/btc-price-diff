# Bitcoin Price Comparison Calculator

This web app helps you compare Bitcoin prices from different exchanges or platforms to see which one gives you the best value for your investment.

## What It Does

1. Enter two different Bitcoin prices (Price 1 and Price 2)
2. Enter your investment amount (in USD or EUR)
3. See which price gives you more value for your money

## How It Works

The app calculates:
- How much Bitcoin you get at each price
- How much more or less value your investment would have at each price
- Which price gives you the better deal

For example, if:
- Price 1: $50,000
- Price 2: $52,000
- Your investment: $10,000

The app will show you:
- How much more value you get by buying at the lower price
- The exact amount of Bitcoin you get at each price
- Which price is the better deal for your investment
